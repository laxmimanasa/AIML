🌿 Plant Seedling Species Classification
📌 Domain:
Botanical Research

🧪 Context:
University X is conducting research to identify and analyze plant species at various stages of seedling growth. The goal is to automate plant species identification using image classification techniques. The dataset comprises thousands of plant images spanning 12 different species.

🎯 Project Objective:
To build a computer vision classifier that can accurately determine the species of a plant from an image using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

📁 Dataset:
Source: Kaggle - Plant Seedlings Classification

The dataset includes labeled images of 12 plant species in various stages of seedling development.
